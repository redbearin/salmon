I used the MDN page titled "Traversing an HTML table with JavaScript and DOM Interfaces" material on tables. It was very helpful because I could play with the code in CodePen and understand how it works. The combination of code and visual feedback is SUPER helpful. 

Ed was super helpful in teaching me concepts and helping me debug code. He also helped me with git and walked me through the process of translating a problem statement to code (one of my biggest hurdles).

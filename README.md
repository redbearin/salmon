I used the MDN page titled "Traversing an HTML table with JavaScript and DOM Interfaces" material on tables. It was very helpful because I could play with the code in CodePen and understand how it works. The combination of code and visual feedback is SUPER helpful. 

Jackie did an excellent job of explaining the rendering process.

Ed was super helpful in teaching me concepts and helping me debug code. He also helped me with git and walked me through the process of translating a problem statement to code (one of my biggest hurdles).

For reason the total function in not working. It was close to working earlier, but is out again.

The form has been created, but it is not operational. I am still struggling with the event listening feature. I attempted to build the funtionality from the lecture, but was not successful. 

I played with some CSS features and am starting to understand how I can get some of the features to work .

I am not sure how to convert the time to am and pm.
